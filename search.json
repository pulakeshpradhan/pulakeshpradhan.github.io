    "section": "",
    "text": "Google Earth Engine (GEE) has revolutionized the way we handle petabytes of satellite imagery. However, as the field of Spatial Data Science matures, many researchers are looking for open-source alternatives that offer more flexibility, data sovereignty, and integration with modern AI frameworks.\nIn this post, we explore the “Beyond GEE” ecosystem—a combination of cloud-native formats, distributed computing, and powerful programming libraries.\n\n\nThe backbone of the modern open-source stack is the Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). Unlike traditional TIFFs, COGs allow for “range requests,” meaning you only download the specific pixels you need.\nComplementing this is STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog). It provides a common language to describe geospatial datasets, making data discovery across different providers (Microsoft Planetary Computer, AWS, etc.) seamless.\n\n\n\nIf you miss the “instant” scalability of GEE, the Pangeo ecosystem is your answer. By combining Xarray (for multidimensional arrays) with Dask (for parallel computing), you can perform heavy-duty analysis on your own cluster or local machine.\n\nCheck out: odc-stac for loading STAC items into Xarray objects.\n\n\n\n\nThe Planetary Computer is perhaps the strongest competitor to GEE. It provides a massive catalog of open data and a managed JupyterHub environment (the Explorer and Hub). Since it’s built on STAC and Xarray, it provides a much more “Pythonic” experience compared to GEE’s JavaScript-centric API.\n\n\n\nFor those who prefer keeping data local or working on smaller scales: - Python: libraries like geopandas, rasterio, and rioxarray have become the industry standard. - R: The terra and sf packages offer incredible speed and reliability for spatial operations.\n\n\n\nExploring open-source options isn’t about replacing GEE entirely—it’s about adding more tools to your belt. Many of my innovations, like deepgee, actually serve as bridges between the GEE cloud and the local open-source Python ecosystem.\nBy mastering both, you become a more versatile Spatial Data Scientist, capable of handling data wherever it lives.\n\nWhat is your favorite open-source spatial tool? Let me know in the comments!"
