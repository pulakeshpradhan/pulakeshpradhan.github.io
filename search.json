I am thrilled to share my journey as a geographer and spatial data scientist with a global community of researchers and developers.\nThis blog will serve as a space for: - Tutorials: Deep dives into Google Earth Engine, Python, and R for geospatial analysis. - Project Updates: Behind-the-scenes looks at the development of my innovations like geeadvance and deepgee. - Field Notes: Insights from workshops, research conventions, and academic fieldwork.\nSince this is a platform for geographers, expect to see a lot of satellite imagery, code snippets, and spatial insights. Whether you are a student just starting with GIS or a professional looking for advanced AI-driven spatial tools, I hope you find this content valuable.\nFeel free to leave comments using your GitHub account—I look forward to engaging in technical discussions and collaborations!"
